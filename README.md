Keyboard capturing is the action of recording the keys stroke on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that the person
using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored.
It is used to track the users which logs keystrokes; uses log files to retrieve information. In this keylogger project,
whenever the user types something through the keyboard, the keystrokes are captured and mailed to the mail id of
admin without the knowledge of the user within the time set.
